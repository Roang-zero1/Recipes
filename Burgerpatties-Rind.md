## Ingredients

* 500 grams minced beef, not too lean
* 1 eggs
* ½ cup bread crumbs
* 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped
* ½ brown onion, finely chopped
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* Salt
* Freshly ground black pepper
* Butter
* 4 burger buns, cut in half
* Cos lettuce leaves

## Preparation

1.  In a large bowl mix the beef mince, one of the eggs, the bread crumbs, parsley, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper.  
Divide the mixture into four equal portions.  
Roll each portion into a ball and then flatten with the palm of your hand to a thickness of about 1cm.
1.  Using your thumb, make an indentation into the centre of the patty.  
This helps to keep the patties a consistent thickness when cooking.  
Once the patties have been made, set them aside on a plate and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
1.  Prepare the barbecue for direct cooking over medium heat (180°C to 230°C) with a hotplate or Weber Ware Frying Pan.
1.  Place the patties directly on the cooking grill and cook over direct medium heat, with the lid closed, for 3 to 4 minutes.  
Open the lid and turn the patties.
1. When the patties are cooked, remove from the grill and set aside to rest.  
While the patties are resting, place the burger buns on the grill, cut side down and cook for 1 minute.
1. Remove the buns from the grill and assemble the burgers with a patty, a rasher of bacon, lettuce, a fried egg, and your favourite burger sauce.
