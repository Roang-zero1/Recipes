## Directions

1. Prepare your vegetables.
    1. Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square.
    1. Chop the tomatoes if using fresh tomatoes
    1. Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop.
    1. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.
1. Start cooking.
    1. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat.
    1. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob).
    1. Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.
    1. Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin.
    1. Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
1. Brown 500g lean minced beef.
    1. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula.  
       The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince.
    1. Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits.  
       Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.
1. Make the sauce.
    1. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture.
    1. Add the tomatoes (fresh or from can)
    1. Tip in ½ tsp dried marjoram, 1 tsp sugar (skip if you want to use chocolate) and add a good shake of salt and pepper.
       Squirt in about 2 tbsp tomato purée and stir the sauce well.
1. Simmer it gently. Bring the whole thing to the boil, give it a good stir and put a lid on the pan. 
1. Turn down the heat until it is gently bubbling and leave it for 20 minutes.
1. Check on the pan occasionally to stir it and make sure the sauce doesn’t catch on the bottom of the pan or isn’t drying out.
   If it is, add a couple of tablespoons of water and make sure that the heat really is low enough.
   After simmering gently, the saucy mince mixture should look thick, moist and juicy.
1. Drain and rinse the red kidney beans and the corn in a sieve and stir them into the chilli pot.
1. Add thumbnail-sized piece of dark chocolate if you did not add sugar
1. Bring to the boil again, and gently bubble without the lid for another 10 minutes, adding a little more water if it looks too dry.
1. Season
1. Now replace the lid, turn off the heat and leave your chilli to stand for 10 minutes before serving.
